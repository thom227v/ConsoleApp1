Check if leaderboard is redundant, if so remove it

Fix reroll (start using DiceToRoll() again), instead of rolling all always, 

Fix when player wants to reroll using indexing, like 1 2 5

make sure players cant pick the same name

make sure players cant pick the same choice more than once 




make it so game before hand checks if you even can make a choice, and if you can which ones, and if you cant make it so you cant make a choice, and there is nothing to do

make it so somehow files are automatically included inside of the project
